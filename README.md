AdventureWorks EDA Project: Analyzing Microsoft's Sample Data

Project Overview :

AdventureWorks database Supports Online transaction Processing approach. AdventureWorks Cycles is a prominent manufacturer and distributor of bicycles and components across global markets. The project aims to conduct in depth analysis to explore and understand the relationship between different variables with a special focus on store,sales and employee performance.  By deciphering these relationships, the goal is to extract actionable insights that can enhance decision-making and potentially streamline business operations.

Methodology :

Employing a blend of statistical analysis techniques and data visualization methods, this analysis journey begins by delving into correlation analysis. This method allows us to understand the relationship or strength between different variables.

Tasks :

1. What are the regional sales in the best performing country?
2. What is the relationship between annual leave taken and bonus?
3. What is the relationship between Country and Revenue?
4. What is the relationship between sick leave and Job Title (PersonType)?
5 .What is the relationship between store trading duration and revenue?
6. What is the relationship between the size of the stores, number of employees and revenue?


Tools Employed:
The project workflow incorporates various tools to ensure robust analysis and visualization:

SQL Server Management Studio: The initial phase involves data extraction using SQL queries within SQL Server Management Studio. Necessary columns are selected from SQL data and exported as .csv files, laying the groundwork for subsequent analysis.
Python and Jupyter: Python emerges as the primary driver for data analysis and visualization. Jupyter serves as the central platform for executing Python code, facilitating a seamless analytical process.
Libraries: The project leverages three essential Python libraries. Pandas is instrumental in loading datasets and executing data analysis, while Matplotlib.pyplot and Seaborn shine as indispensable tools for data visualization.
